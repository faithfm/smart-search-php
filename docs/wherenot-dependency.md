# Installing Additional Dependency for whereNot():

Note: If using Laravel 8 (vs Laravel >=9), support for the **whereNot()** function needs to be provided using the following package: https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-eloquent-where-not.

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-eloquent-where-not
```

...and register the macro as described in their [installation instructions ](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-eloquent-where-not#installation).
